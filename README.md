- Welcome to my ShopClues, an e-commerce website built using ReactJS and styled with Tailwind CSS. This project aims to allow users to browse and shop for a variety of products.

###  Technologies Used
- ReactJS: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- API: Integration with a product API to fetch and display product data.

### API Integration

- The ShopClues fetches product data from an external API to populate the website with products. The API endpoints used for fetching product data are documented in the api.js file in the project's source code. Make sure to replace the API endpoints with the actual URLs you're using.
